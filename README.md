# evaluate-hand

How good is your poker hand, really? This will tell you, using an ultra-convenient command line interface.

## Installation

Clone me. Make sure you have leiningen installed.

## Usage

From your favorite terminal (which had better be ```zsh``` because that's the best one):

    $ lein run Qs 10s As Ks Js

(You feel lucky, right?)

For those who love typing, there is also an extra verbose format:

    $ lein run Queen of Spades Ten of Spades Ace of Spades King of Spades Jack of Spades
